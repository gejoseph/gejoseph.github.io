          <h4 data-scroll class="section-text roots-right right-text">
            Prior to forming teams, we were individually tasked with conducting background 
            research into the topic of home-buying and create stakeholder and customer journey maps
             based on those findings.

          <h4 data-scroll class="roots-right right-text">
            For my <strong class="underline roots-underline">stakeholder journey map</strong>, I began by researching the roles of the various agents and intermediaries involved in the home-buying process.
            From my research I was able to map together the overall flow of involvement and also categorize the stakeholders by whether they were primarily working
            with the buyer, the seller, or both in tandem. I also placed stakeholders that were only involved once a sale had been agreed upon by the buyer and 
            seller inside the oval, providing a sense of the timing of the stakeholders' involvement.
          </h4>
          <h4 data-scroll class="roots-left left-text">
            I approached my <strong class="underline roots-underline">customer journey map</strong> with a focus on not
            only the order of actions that compose the home-buying process, but the various systems, emotions, thought processes, 
            and pain points that are part of each stage. From there, I assessed each column and added the potential 
            opportunities for innovation in that stage.

          <h4 data-scroll class="section-text  roots-right right-text">
            Ultimately what these maps revealed was the complexity
             in terms of the financial process of buying home. There are so many intermediaries and agents involved
             just in the financing as well as so many pain points/negative emotions tied to the financial
             stages in the process that we decided to narrow our focus on alleviating the stress associated with the financing.

            Now that we had formed teams and narrowed down the scope of our solution to be focused on the financial stress 
            associated with buying a home. We wanted to begin by looking at existing resources dedicated to informing 
            people on their finances so we could understand the limitations of the tools out there. We chose to conduct a Think-Aloud 
            study with the website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders?bucket_id=dt-mrt&ds_rl=1246084&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioIC30k79KZLguKZP72ntufocU0XG9mWYJaG_SAMX9QG_jbjKZ_ibicaAjMHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&mktg_body=1678&mktg_hline=19538&mktg_img=3598&mktg_place=kwd-40958987563%7D&model_execution_id=603C6723-4E5C-41F5-8427-33DE6E7A18CC&nw_campaign_id=150238270218585900&utm_campaign=cc_mktg_paid_060716_brand_exact&utm_content=ta&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=goog&utm_term=nerdwallet">NerdWallet</a>
             to discover what makes it effective and ineffective in educating young adults on mortgages, loans, and personal saving in preparation for a home. We prepared a series of tasks and had the 
             interviews (our peers from other classes) verbalize their thought process while completing them. From this and a series of post-interview questions, we were able to 
             realize that users want to be able to have resources to learn more about the long-term gains, so they feel more motivated to invest or begin saving.

            We interviewed four recent alumnae of Carnegie Mellon University to discuss their current financial habits. We asked them to come prepared with three artifacts for discussion: what advice their parents gave them, their top 5 financial goals for the next ten years, and the materials they use for their personal budgeting. We learned that how much you pay in rent has a large impact on how much you can save for future home buying. Participants recommended living at home or with roommates to reduce rent. We also learned that there is a desire for a financial planning tool that is geared more towards young adults and their specific spending habits.

            One of our biggest and most telling finds was that people who are first time home 
            buyers would prefer to have advice come from professionals, and they do not prefer 
            testimonials from other ordinary people on the internet. They also believe that finances 
            are too personal of an issue to discuss in depth with strangers in their same position, 
            especially in an online chat setting.
