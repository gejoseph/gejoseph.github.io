            Last Spring, eager to learn more about how design can impact sustainability, 
            I took a course called Designing for Climate Change. For our first project, we
            were tasked with calculating our carbon footprint, identifying the primary contributor to our footprint, 
            and ideating on possible measures or tools that can help 
            <i class="underline ecomap-underline"><strong>propel a decarbonized future.</strong></i>

            I realized that my mobility and shelter were the most significant contributors to my carbon
            usage. Prior to this class, I hadn't really grasped the impact of every flight, every drive, 
            every increase on the thermostat, and every extra light on in my apartment.

            After examining the results, I chose to focus on mobility for my project because I didn’t really
             have much information regarding my utilities and their efficiency since I was only 
             paying for my internet and electricity, relying on the default values when inputting them into the calculators.

            I then applied Sohail Inayatullah's futurist framework of Causal Layered Analysis, identifying the litany, systems, 
            worldview, and myths / metaphors that informed my mobility in the year 2020. As you can see below, I immediately identified 
            my own incognizance of my carbon behaviors as a result of systems that conceal the true ramifications of pursuing convenient transportation methods.

            Those of us who chose mobility as our focus then bounced around ideas for potential solutions /

            We affinity diagrammed our ideas and in the process of doing so, determined the various subdomains within the

            subdomain could be combined or fleshed out, eventually mapping each subdomain of ideas the impact of ideas in that space 
            against the ease of adoption of the ideas in the real world. I was more drawn to ideas that were easy to adopt than those that 
            had a larger impact because I felt it was important that people first have access to the information necessary to feel the 
            need or compulsion to care about the issue in the first place. As a result, I decided to target generating transparency in data 
            as it pertains to our individual carbon footprints.

            experience of remaining ignorant of the carbon impact of my travel (particularly my flights) informed my storyboard. 
            Very simplistic, my storyboard conveyed a platform in which I could easily make myself not only aware of the impact of my 
            travel but also the potential ways in which I could offset such an impact.

           In an attempt to build off of existing mental models and maximize ease of adoption, I decided my idea 
           would be a mobile application that creates transparency over the carbon emissions associated 
           with different modes of transportation and displays opportunities to lower emissions. Essentially this application 
           would serve as a re-imagined, sustainablility-oriented, google maps (or even a potential API or extension 
           if we want to optimize integration further).<br><br>

            <li><strong>transparency: </strong>calculates footprint associated with a selected route and mode of transport</li>
            <li><strong>potential for impact: </strong> provides reduction strategies and offset options for each mode</li>
            <li><strong>carbon consciousness: </strong> tracks net CO2 emissions based on offsets and routes</li>
            <li>bonus: highlights EV charging stations, restaurants with vegan options, certified B corps, thrift shops, etc.</li>

            Once I had fleshed out the concept, I evaluated it once more with regard to the same CLA framework I had used to initially

               transparency regarding carbon emissions and accessibility of strategies to reduce or offset those emissions will lead to a 
               more sustainable future. Sometimes we want to do the right thing, but we're not sure what the right thing is or I guess more truly, 
               we'd rather not do the wrong thing than do the right thing → an increase in accessibility of the problem and the potential solutions
