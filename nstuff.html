            In Spring of 2022, I took Service Design, 
            an HCI course focused on learning how to use use service thinking and associated 
            methods and tools to understand product service systems (PSS), identify opportunities 
            to create value through service, design a service, test it and situate it in the PSS. 
            The client for this course was N Stuff Music, a local music shop known throughout the U.S. 
            for their high quality equipment and variety of service offerings.  Our task over the course 
            of the semester was to  <strong class="underline nstuff-underline">conduct ample research 
            and generate a service proposition for N Stuff Music that emphasizes a co-creation of value

The co-owner led us on a tour of the main store, the Next Door Cafe, and the Little Lesson House. After the tour, we interviewed him about overall goals for his business. We then interviewed a long-term customer and another customer who picked up a repaired keyboard. We also observed an employee while he carried out the repair checkout process and interviewed him afterwards.</h4></li>
                <li><h4><strong>Informational Research:</strong> While there aren’t many sites or articles dedicated specifically evaluating the store in its entirety, N Stuff has amassed a significant amount of reviews online on Google (1,165 with 4.9 stars on average), yelp (36 with 5 stars on average), and Facebook (265 with 4.9 stars on average). Outside of their site, they upload information regarding their products + services on Facebook and YouTube. Just from these outside sources alone, it’s clear that they have employees dedicated to monitoring their presence on social media. </h4></li>
                <li><h4><strong>Experiential Digital Research:</strong> N Stuff has a very established website that allows its users to purchase or rent instruments, register for lessons, view options for repairs, as well as access information regarding events and their cafe. The lessons and the cafe have their own separate sites that connect to the main site. Users can also access contact information and message the store from within the website. While it appears that most of the services they provide are accessible through the store, N Stuff’s revenue primarily comes from their in-store operation, suggesting that the human engagement that comes with the store is a point of preference among customers.

              We ultimately ended up going with Idea #1 due to its clear value for both musicians and N Stuff. 
              Additionally this idea utilizes existing services and equipment available at the storefront and keeps
              the instruments specifically on site, limiting the risks associated with a rental. This idea also just felt 
              like the last step in the services already provided by N Stuff given that they already handle every other aspect of 
              an aspiring musician's lifecycle. Below is the service blueprint for what a musician looking for a recording service
              currently looks like.

                    For an amateur musician looking to record on their own, the primary touchpoints are the internet and/or stores
                    for the purposes of learning how to record as well as purchasing the correct equipment necessary to do so. The 
                    primary support process for this is simply the payment platform used to purchase the equipment.

          <h4 data-scroll data-scroll class="section-text nstuff-right right-text">
           In our initial pitch of our idea to N Stuff, we used a persona of an aspiring musician named Andy to illustrate the value 
           of our concept for potential customers. We focused on explaining how this service builds off of N Stuff's current values of 
            remaining customer-centric, comprehensive, and resourceful. We centered our pitch around the insight that 
            <strong class="underline nstuff-underline">budding musicians often don’t know where to start when it comes to recording.</strong>
          </h4>
          <img src="assets/nstuff/nstuff-initial-pitch-1.png" class="center-image" alt="">
          <h4 data-scroll data-scroll class="section-text nstuff-right right-text">
            There are many potential variations or additions to this idea that we also proposed. Musicians that like to record 
            regularly could benefit from a subscription model in terms of how they book time in the studio. They could pay a 
            monthly fee and have a specified recurring time slot or a specific number of hours per month they can spend recording. 
            This would also make first-timers feel less pressure to perfect their recording on the first try. 
            Another add-on could be the utilization of instruments. N Stuff currently does rentals for customers, so combining 
            this with the recording time could allow musicians to rent higher quality instruments for their recordings and those 
            rented instruments would never have to leave the store, minimizing the risk of damage for N Stuff. 
            Finally, in addition to the recording fee, N Stuff could profit over marketing / distribution as well. 
            Musicians who record at N Stuff could have their music advertised at N Stuff for an additional fee, or 
            if they have physical albums could have them distributed at N Stuff for a fee. N Stuff would be able to 
            earn commissions while still helping customers promote their music.

           <h4 data-scroll data-scroll class="section-text nstuff-right right-text">
            Justin, the current owner of N Stuff, listened to our pitch and emphasized, that while our idea 
            was great in theory, there was a fundamental issue concerning a lack of human resources available at N Stuff 
            to help potential customers record and provide them feedback on their music. He suggested we consider researching 
            music production apprentices and incorporating them into our idea in order to address the human resource constraint.

            <h4 data-scroll class="section-text nstuff-right right-text">
                After the presentation, we realized we needed to address the staffing issue as the first 
                step to realizing our vision. Looking back, there were gaps in our understanding of all the 
                people involved in the recording process and the skills necessary to produce music. While 
                we had intended the studio to be for purely recording, the feedback from the client suggests 
                that there is some sound engineering and editing that needs to be included in order for 
                the studio to be worthwhile to musicians wanting to record. In order to test our initial idea further, 
                explore the idea of an apprentice, as well as try to iterate on our idea based on the feedback provided 
                by N Stuff, we created storyboards and interviewed aspiring musicians as well as more N Stuff employees.
