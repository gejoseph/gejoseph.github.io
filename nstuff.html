            In Spring of 2022, I took Service Design, 
            an HCI course focused on learning how to use use service thinking and associated 
            methods and tools to understand product service systems (PSS), identify opportunities 
            to create value through service, design a service, test it and situate it in the PSS. 
            The client for this course was N Stuff Music, a local music shop known throughout the U.S. 
            for their high quality equipment and variety of service offerings.  Our task over the course 
            of the semester was to  <strong class="underline nstuff-underline">conduct ample research 
            and generate a service proposition for N Stuff Music that emphasizes a co-creation of value 
            between N Stuff and its target audience.</strong>

            Now that we had formed teams and narrowed down the scope of our solution to be focused on the financial stress 
            associated with buying a home. We wanted to begin by looking at existing resources dedicated to informing 
            people on their finances so we could understand the limitations of the tools out there. We chose to conduct a Think-Aloud 
            study with the website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders?bucket_id=dt-mrt&ds_rl=1246084&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioIC30k79KZLguKZP72ntufocU0XG9mWYJaG_SAMX9QG_jbjKZ_ibicaAjMHEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&mktg_body=1678&mktg_hline=19538&mktg_img=3598&mktg_place=kwd-40958987563%7D&model_execution_id=603C6723-4E5C-41F5-8427-33DE6E7A18CC&nw_campaign_id=150238270218585900&utm_campaign=cc_mktg_paid_060716_brand_exact&utm_content=ta&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=goog&utm_term=nerdwallet">NerdWallet</a>
             to discover what makes it effective and ineffective in educating young adults on mortgages, loans, and personal saving in preparation for a home. We prepared a series of tasks and had the 
             interviews (our peers from other classes) verbalize their thought process while completing them. From this and a series of post-interview questions, we were able to 
             realize that users want to be able to have resources to learn more about the long-term gains, so they feel more motivated to invest or begin saving.

          <h4 data-scroll data-scroll class="section-text nstuff-right right-text">
            We interviewed four recent alumnae of Carnegie Mellon University to discuss their current financial habits. We asked them to come prepared with three artifacts for discussion: what advice their parents gave them, their top 5 financial goals for the next ten years, and the materials they use for their personal budgeting. We learned that how much you pay in rent has a large impact on how much you can save for future home buying. Participants recommended living at home or with roommates to reduce rent. We also learned that there is a desire for a financial planning tool that is geared more towards young adults and their specific spending habits.

            One of our biggest and most telling finds was that people who are first time home 
            buyers would prefer to have advice come from professionals, and they do not prefer 
            testimonials from other ordinary people on the internet. They also believe that finances
