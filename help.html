            Last Spring, I took a course called Integrated Product Conceptualization where we were divided into teams and went 
            through the first three phases of the integrated new product development (iNPD) process:
              1) identifying opportunities for a new product or service; 2) understanding one opportunity
               through stakeholder research, value opportunity analysis, and competitive landscape
                assessment; and 3) conceptualizing the opportunity with the goal of meeting the value proposition.
           The challenge we focused on for this course was student loans, so our initial problem statement was: 
            <i class="underline help-underline"><strong>How can we clarify the conversation and innovate for student debt?</strong></i>

            In order to identify our Product Opportunity Gap and ultimate Problem Statement, we 
            had to first identify the PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, 
            Legal, and Environmental) factors influencing our problem space of student debt. Our research
             led us to find 50 PESTLE factors, which we then categorized based on priority in the domain. From there 
             we identified 50 Product Opportunity Gaps (POGs) that we then affinity diagrammed by categories redolent of 
             our PESTLE factors.

            </ul>
            <h4>
              Opportunity #2: Our research revealed that the perception against community college
               is so strong in society even though there is substantial research supporting students 
               beginning their collegiate journeys there. Most people oppose this option because of 
               "extremely lower graduation rates". However, four year universities have low graduation
                rates as well. The official four-year graduation rate for students attending public 
                colleges and universities is 33.3%. and the official graduation rate for a community 
                college degree in four years is 28%. Although, some argue an associate's degree won't be 
                nearly as profitable, the average salary is $46,124 compared to $51,347 with a bachelor's degree. 
                Students who pursue an associates from a community college in four years will likely have the time to 
                work while attending college and pay off costs so expenses can be more manageable if more people 
                considered community college. So since the benefit of community college can relieve a huge economic 
                burden for students our team interest was high and our scalability was high because community college
                 options are available nationwide and once the stigma is gone we could help millions of dollars in 
                 debt be prevented.
             </h4>
             <h4>
               Opportunity #5: After further research into studies conducted on how education in high schools
                about college can affect admission, the number of contextual factors that contribute to a student’s
                 understanding of the college process were better understood. Studies convey that families 
                 of students must also be educated on the process in order for such education to be effective
                  in limiting student loans in the long-term. Additionally, insight into how such education 
                  would need to be tailored to demographic and region, as exemplified by rural students needing
                   to learn more about how industries like agriculture and timber now require more than a 
                   high school diploma, suggesting that the potential solution would be somewhat feasible, 
                   but more complex and layered than initially thought.

            more proximal and obvious stakeholders, like our families, friends (high school and college ones), and guidance counselors. 
            From there we conducted research into the various paths of higher education, which led us to add stakeholders involved in 
            the military / ROTC recruitment process. After that, our research was focused on how loan offices can provide 
            insight to students on the financial weight attached to each form of higher education.

            For our <strong class="underline help-underline">customer journey map</strong>, in addition to researching online, 
            we held interviews with high school students to pinpoint the various stages in which they absorb information about higher education, 
            and understand what priorities exist across the timeline before they decide on their path.

            For our <strong class="underline help-underline">positioning map</strong>, we used our prior maps to 
            determine which products / services already exist in the market that are relevant to our problem space, 
            stakeholders, and customers. We mapped each product / service by how high or low tech it is as well as whether 
            the product / service is more experiential or informational. We aimed to innovate towards the upper right quadrant, 
            so we wanted to pinpoint the values attached to the products / services currently in the upper right.

            We further investigated our POG through interviews and surveys to our stakeholders; high school & college students, guidance counselors, and military troops. Our primary research led to two themed responses.The first is that private colleges are viewed as being so superior in their quality and that high school seniors do not have the capacity to fully understand how much time debt takes to pay back and how much it affects life. From this we determined that our key findings are that it is important to standardly educate high school students about financial options and how those relate to trade/military/4 year college. We also learned that our solution should effectively communicate about the potential incurrence of loan debt and accurately portray how long it will take to pay it off. Our last key finding was to ensure our solution has accessible information surrounding loan debt and higher education options.

            Our next analysis was our Value Opportunity Analysis comparing our goal solution to current FAFSA and Guidance Counselor attributes. After ranking attributes and analyzing the importance of each one we decided on our mandatory product requirements for our solution. These attributes are Security & Safety (protect a key stakeholder’s personal information), Visual & Ease of Use (clearly outlined and easy to use from both a physical and cognitive perspective), Enabling & Durability (enables the key stakeholder to leverage our technology and will last for many years to come), and Point in Time ( aligns with modern times utilizing up-to-date technologies, information, features, and aesthetics).

          <h4 data-scroll class="section-text help-right right-text">
            To conceptualize a solution we decided to employ numerous ideating strategies in our brainstorming sessions 
            (crazy 8's, Reverse Assumptions, Bad Ideas List, etc.) before finally analyzing and developing our top 3 concepts. 
            Our top concepts ended up being H.E.L.P -- Higher Education Learning Platform -- a data-driven website 
            filled with clear information of a variety of college and financial aid options; 
            Community-Wide Hub, community center of guidance counselors that help students explore post high-school options; 
            and a “Day in the Life” program, an experiential college opportunity. Our final concept ended up being the 
            Higher Education Learning Platform (HELP). HELP is an online tool to help high school students navigate 
            collegiate choices based on a database that analyzes the academic, social, and financial attributes of 
            each post graduation option. Through this tool students would have access to the most up to date information, 
            financial literacy education, and remote & in-person college experiential programs. The goal of this 
            platform is to expand the mindsets of high school students and grant them the opportunity to look into 
            more feasible college options that might have not been considered.

              H.E.L.P would facilitate the process of finding information about different avenues for higher education,

              H.E.L.P can be personalized to each student through its financial questionnaire which provides students insight into 
              the various financial factors they need to consider when deciding upon higher education and from there points them 
              towards options that suit their ideal financial status upon graduation or completion.

            Ultimately our goal with this site was to provide more transparency to students about their options for higher education. 
            For some students, the financial weight attached to traditional college / university often dissuades them from 
            even considering higher education at all, so having the ability to customize your search and educate yourself on the 
            not only all the financial considerations involved, but all the various paths out there is extremely valuable.
