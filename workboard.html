            This past summer I interned at WorkBoard, 
            an enterprise SaaS company delivering Objectives & Key Results (OKR) 
            software and expertise. As a software engineering intern on the Accessibility team,
             I worked on remediating the WorkBoard help center to make it more accessible,

             emoji picker component from scratch using React for WorkBoard’s platform.

            <strong>Did you know that only 3% of the internet is accessible? 
              Or that statistically speaking, every person will experience 
              some form of a disability for at least 8 years in their life?</strong>
              With the tech sector projected to hire 3x as many employees with 
              disabilities in the next five years, it’s more important than 
              ever to make software accessible to everyone. WorkBoard, a 
              market leader in OKR enterprise software, has made strides on 
              this front -- developing rigorous processes focused on making 
              the platform accessible. My internship has specifically allowed 
              me to become a part of this movement, enabling me to educate myself 
              on accessibility software engineering and providing me the opportunity 
              to help educate the rest of the company on the significance of digital inclusivity.

          <h4 class="section-text workboard-right right-text">
            We began by spending our first week doing Accessibility training in preparation 
            for our first project working on making our Help Center articles on Zendesk more 
            screen reader accessible. Screen Readers rely on the use of semantically correct 
            HTML and descriptive links among many other best practices in order to make content 
            accessible, the WYSIWYG editor that Zendesk and many other applications use does not 
            take this into consideration​.  So we determined a 
            list of priority articles and then dove into the HTML associated with each article 
            to remediate. We looked for things like images with missing alt text, lists that 
            are not using the native list tag, added ARIA-labels, made the links descriptive, 
            and made changes to the UI to address color contrast issues​.

          <h2 class="work-page-section-title underline workboard-underline">ZeroHeight Design System</h2>
          <h4 class="section-text workboard-right right-text">
            Zeroheight is a collaborative platform that allows companies to 
            prepare and maintain design system documentation for a component library. 
            A Design system is essential in digital product design and an ideal design 
            system consists of reusable components that follow clear style guidelines 
            and ZeroHeight is how we document the nuances of each component and these 
            style guidelines. I documented each of the most essential components in ZeroHeight, such that 
            each has their own page with a style guide showcasing the different states of the component, a 
            usage guide that goes through the do’s and don’t for the component as 
            well as its variants, sizing, color, and alignment standards, an 
            accessibility page that details how the component’s design and 
            intended implementation meet the essential accessibility standards, 
            and a live demo where you can interact with the component once it is 
            implemented in WorkBoard's component library. Having the design system organized 
            in this way helps build transparency in the design process, 
            especially regarding accessibility, and will also allow for 
            developers and quality assurance engineers to better understand the intended design of each component.

          <h4 class="section-text workboard-right right-text">
            Finally, my intern partner and I working on an Emoji Picker component for the component library. 
            We began by looking at Open Source solutions and scoped out the necessary attributes 
            for an ideal emoji picker such as a skin tone picker for inclusivity and an emoji infobar for 
            accessibility. Since the Emoji Picker is a very complex compositional component, 
            we wanted to employ the ideologies behind atomic design, looking through the component 
            library to find the building blocks for the Emoji Picker component. So 
            throughout our iterative design process, we took these building blocks into 
            consideration, applying the existing design guidelines for the popper and 
            search component into our design for an ideal implementation. After meeting with the designers, 
            developers, and PMs to discuss the design and implementation details, we began designing 
            the picker on figma and created an interactive prototype as you can see below​. We are 
            currently working on implementing this in React.
