            This past fall, I took the course Mobile Application Design and Development, which is sponsored by Capital One and consists 
            of students forming groups to develop an app of their own design over 15 weeks (6 sprints). 
            It includes a contest and cash prize with each team having to give a 15 minute pitch, a demo, 
            and a promo video of their app to Faculty and Sponsors. 
            My team <span class="underline bouncr-underline">built an app that streamlines the event 
              management process called Bouncr</span> by providing a platform to create events, keep track of invitations, 
              and check-in guests at the door. <span class="underline bouncr-underline">Capital One awarded our app the first prize</span> among all 19 teams. 
                Bouncr is slated to be available on the app store in Spring 2022.

            Our app is an event access management tool that allows users to either create an event with a specified guest list or easily gain access to events where they are invited. Hosts can generate exclusivity with their events by sending tickets to their guestlist and those guests can easily get into the event by using the QR code that comes with their ticket. As guests arrive, the app provides statistics to guests about how many people are invited, which of their friends have already checked in to the event, and how many people are at the event of those invited.

            For college students especially, hosting an event can be tumultuous and 
            unpredictable in terms of making sure only those specifically invited are let in. 
            Events can get out of control and are difficult to manage when more people show up than 
            anticipated, which is especially concerning in the aftermath of the pandemic. The person 
            responsible for making sure only those invited can enter the event often doesn’t know 
            everyone invited personally and likely feels awkward turning people away. 
            With this app, all it takes is QR codes to verify that the attendee is invited 
            and the host(s) can track and publish a real-time number of attendees who have 
            checked in. From an attendee perspective, this app also facilitates the process 
            of attending events by making it easy to receive invitations, respond to them, 
            and then attend the event. Additionally, if both parties permit, each attendee 
            can see which of their friends from the app have been invited to a given event 
            and see if they have arrived, helping them decide whether or not they want to go to the event.

            For our first version, we focused on developing the attendee and host views and streamlining the checkin process by automatically creating invite cards that contain a QR code that can be scanned to update the attendance. The only features we held off implementing for V2 were the friend requests and friend related statistics associated with an event. Beyond that we also left many superficial changes for version 2.

          <h4 class="section-text bouncr-right right-text">
            After conducting user tests with 6 potential end-users, we were able to not only understand how navigable our app is in its current state of progress, but also locate numerous UI bugs that we can fix in order to enhance the current user experience. While most users found it quite easy to navigate to the different pages and index their own events and invites, the microinteractions / gestures associated with performing smaller actions within each tab turned out to be difficult at times. For instance, many users thought that tapping a second time to switch back from spread out invite cards to stacked invite cards was not intuitive. Additionally, many users were concerned about the lack of confirmation associated with editing and deleting events as well as throughout the entire scanning process, suggesting that they need continuous feedback throughout their interactions with the app. 
          </h4>
          <h4 class="section-text bouncr-right right-text">
            While designing our app in the earlier sprints, we tried to build off of existing mental models by incorporating UI elements and features similar to commonly used apps, like Apple Wallet, Google Calendar, Venmo, etc. Throughout our testing, it was clear that these design choices came across to users in both positive and negative lights. While many users were pleased with how we included wallet-like stacked cards and google-esque floating buttons, some users found switching between the invitation stack configurations less intuitive and the concept of “friends” and “friending” in the context of our app — something traditionally seen in social media platforms — as played out and yet another barrier in the way of usability.
